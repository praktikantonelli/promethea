# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains the ADRs that have been created and applied to this project. The initial ADRs have been created retrospectively and already contain the finished designs. 

## Updates

Changes to existing ADRs will happen by creating a new ADR and giving it a title that clearly states how it supersedes an existing ADR, and its content will demonstrate why this change was necessary. In such a case, the status of the old ADR will change from "Accepted" to "Superseded by ADR-XXXX".
